      <p>Skiing has been a part of the Olympic program since the first Winter Games in Chamonix, France in 1924. Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, and Nordic combined (which combines elements of cross-country skiing and ski jumping) were included in the first Winter Olympics, and freestyle skiing was added to the program in 1988. The Olympic skiing events are some of the most highly anticipated and watched competitions of the Winter Games, and they showcase the best skiers from around the world competing for Olympic gold. From the heart-pumping action of the downhill races to the graceful movements of cross-country skiing, the skiing events at the Olympics provide a thrilling spectacle that has captivated audiences for nearly a century.</p>
